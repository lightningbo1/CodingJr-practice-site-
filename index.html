          </p>
          <p>
            When you enrol your child in a coding summer camp, you will likely

          <p>
            Have you ever worried that your child takes their
            computers/smartphone/games for granted, without really questioning
            how they work?
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing programming eliminates that concern. If you know how to
            code, computers cease to be "magical" and can instead be
            well-understood.

          future-ready by learning computer programming, logic, graphic design,

          literacy, that is technology creation not just technology consumption,

          At Coding Jr we recognise the difference between playing games
          (technology consumption) and writing the software to build games
          (technology creation). We focus on technology creation because this is
          the foundation for building software, programs, and apps whether they
          are enterprise software, data analysis or game design. The skills
          associated with game design transfers to all other software
          development in terms of problem-solving, logic, algorithmic thinking,
          maths, user interface etc.

          Coding Kids. If it has a keyboard, screen, WiFi, and runs Windows,
          OSX, or a Linux flavour, it's more than sufficient for use.
